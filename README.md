####The brief description of the "eToolStore" project:
Internet shop has **Users** with different roles and possibilities: customers and managerial personal (users and administrator). Customers can register, sign in, operate with products items in their current cart, communicate with managerial personal via email. Users and Administrator can operate with **Products** (CRUD, change status), **Orders** (Edit, Delete, Change current status), and only Administrator have permission to deal with Users (Lock, Unlock, Delete). Also exist a possibility to search and sorting products of some parameters during the browsing.
